**Information on Restoration of Nationality for Overseas Adoptees**

Hello. Today, I will discuss information related to the restoration of nationality for overseas adoptees.

The term "overseas adoptee" here refers to those who were originally citizens of the Republic of Korea, were adopted abroad at a young age, and currently do not hold Korean nationality.

In the past, during difficult times in Korea, many young children were adopted into families in Europe or the United States. These adoptees are now adults, with many in their 40s and 50s.

Among them, there are people who wish to restore their Korean nationality or find their biological family to reconnect with their roots in Korea.

Although Korea does not fundamentally recognize the restoration of nationality, it makes an exception for overseas adoptees who are involved in such cases, allowing them to restore their nationality.

Furthermore, while one must generally be present in Korea to acquire or restore nationality, overseas adoptees can complete the entire procedure from the initial application to the final approval of nationality restoration while remaining abroad. Of course, it is also possible to do so in Korea.

However, there are many documents that need to be prepared, and applicants often struggle with understanding the process due to language barriers and procedural intricacies. Therefore, it can be challenging to prepare everything alone without a fundamental understanding of Korean.

Embassy or consulate officers usually do not actively help unless it is a personal urgent matter or of significant concern to them. They tend to provide only the basic list of required documents without actively assisting in the preparation of these documents.

There was also a case where an official informed overseas adoptees who were hoping for nationality restoration that there was no need for nationality restoration, indicating that it was a difficult situation to address.

I wanted to help alleviate the anxiety of overseas adoptees and actively assist in finding ways to restore their nationality. Fortunately, I was able to directly experience and help with the preparation and consultation of the documents for the restoration of nationality for overseas adoptees.

There were cases where I helped prepare and write documents, submitted them at the embassy, and even completed the process up to the Ministry of Justice in Korea. Another individual made significant efforts to restore their nationality and wanted me to help them as much as possible. At times, the institution that sent the adoptee made mistakes with the documents, making it difficult to verify the individual's identity, which posed additional challenges.

I mentioned that I would find ways to help if I could be of any assistance in Korea, and I eagerly contacted them six months later. However, it seems their contact number has changed, and I have not been able to reach them since.

The basic document list for overseas adoptees to restore their nationality is as follows:

---

1. Application for Nationality Restoration
2. Application for Nationality Recovery
3. Family Relationship Certificate
4. Proof of Identity â€“ In the case of adoptees, adoption documents
5. Basic Certificate and/or Family Relationship Certificate, or equivalent documents
6. Documents proving the acquisition and date of foreign nationality (naturalization certificate or equivalent), and their Korean translations
7. Certificate of Criminal Records from the country of residence
8. One copy of the foreign passport
9. One passport-sized photo
10. Documents proving the acquisition of another nationality for children if applicable (residence permit or equivalent document)
11. Documents proving a change of name after acquiring foreign nationality and their translations
12. Application fee of 200,000 KRW

Preparing these documents alone can be very challenging and time-consuming. For overseas adoptees, I am offering to help with consultation and document preparation at the lowest possible cost. If you need assistance, please contact me at the details below or through Naver Experts.

**Detailed Description**

Hello, I am a civil servant with extensive experience in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Over 12 years, I have accumulated experience, including about 7 years of directly handling visa screening as an officer. Whether you need to apply for a visa to enter Korea or encounter issues during your stay, I can help resolve your questions and concerns through consultation with this service.

**Consultation with a Visa Screening Officer, Extensive Experience to Address Your Concerns**

Nowadays, there is an abundance of information on the internet, and those who are quick to understand may proceed independently. However, those who spend a lot of time and feel overwhelmed may find it difficult to proceed alone.

Just as one might use a map or navigation system to find a destination while driving, it's possible to get lost or face the need to turn back if the journey is long and confusing. This can be frustrating and time-consuming.

Consultation with an experienced officer, who knows the visa-related tasks well, can guide you safely and efficiently, much like a navigation system.

If resolving visa issues is crucial for you, having a one-time consultation might be very beneficial.

If it is inconvenient to speak in Korean, consultations can also be conducted in English, Chinese, or Russian, so please feel free to open the door for consultation.
